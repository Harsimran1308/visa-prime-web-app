                On July 26, 2023, <strong>Marc Miller </strong>assumed the position of <strong>Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</strong> after replacing <strong>Sean Fraser.</strong> His appointment marked the beginning of a series of significant changes in Canada’s immigration policies. Below is a recap of the key actions and shifts that have taken place under his leadership, illustrating how swiftly these changes were implemented:
                </p>
                <h2>
                Adjustments to Immigration Strategy
                </h2>
                <p>
                Amid increasing criticism, especially related to housing shortages, Miller signaled that there could be adjustments to these targets in November 2024. Later, in October 2024, the government decided to reduce the number of permanent residents by 20% starting in 2025, with a target of 365,000 by 2027—down from the original 500,000. This was still above the previous target of 300,000 before Justin Trudeau's government.
                </p>
                <h2>
                Housing and Affordability Concerns
                </h2>
                <p>
                One of the justifications for reducing immigration was the government's belief that higher immigration had contributed to housing shortages, particularly in cities like Vancouver and Toronto. Miller claimed that reducing study permits by 43% had already led to decreased rents in these areas, and the revised targets would help reduce the need for 670,000 housing units by 2027.
                </p>
                <h2>
                International Students and Temporary Workers
                </h2>
                <p>
                Miller also introduced a two-year cap on international student permits in January 2024 and signaled that the number of temporary foreign workers would be reconsidered. This was part of an effort to manage the balance between immigration and the strain on Canada's resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                Dispersal of Asylum Seekers
                </h2>
                <p>
                In September 2024, Miller proposed a plan to disperse asylum seekers across the country, which met resistance from some provincial leaders.

                Controversial Case Involving Ahmed Fouad Mostafa Eldidi
                </h2>
                <p>
                In August 2024, Miller expressed outrage over the case of Ahmed Fouad Mostafa Eldidi, an individual who became a Canadian citizen despite his past involvement in terrorist activities with ISIS. Eldidi had been involved in a beheading in 2018 and was later apprehended in Canada with his son, both of whom were allegedly planning a terror attack related to the 2024 Paris Olympics.

                <h2>
                Changes on LMIA and Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP): 
                </h2>
                <p>
                Several key changes to the Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) process and the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) were announced in 2024 to address ongoing labor market challenges in Canada. As of May 1, 2024, the validity of an LMIA was reduced from 12 months to six months, except for employers in the Recognized Employer Pilot program. A significant shift occurred on August 28, 2024, when the Canadian government ended a pandemic-era policy that allowed visitors to apply for work permits from within Canada. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                Suspending Low Wage LMIA
                </h2>
                <p>
                Starting September 26, 2024, the government suspended processing low-wage LMIAs in census metropolitan areas (CMAs) with an unemployment rate of 6% or higher, with exceptions for sectors like agriculture, food processing, and healthcare. For low-wage workers, the maximum employment duration was reduced from two years to one year, and the percentage of low-wage workers businesses can employ under the TFWP was lowered from 20% to 10% (with some sectors like construction and healthcare maintaining higher caps). 
                </p>
                <h2>
                Disregarding attestations for proof of goods and services
                </h2>
                <p>
                Attestation of Proof of goods & services from a CPA were also no longer accepted as of October 28, 2024. Meanwhile, the wage requirements for the high-wage stream were raised, with candidates needing to earn at least 20% more than the median wage for their position. The government also introduced annual targets for TFWP work permits, with 82,000 new permits set for each of 2025, 2026, and 2027. These measures are part of Canada's broader strategy to reduce the temporary resident population as a percentage of the total population, aiming to lower it from 7% to 5% by 2026.

                <h2>
                Elections 2025: Immigration, Inflation & Housing the key topics of Election Debates.
                </h2>
                <p>
                As 2025 election might happen before 20th October 2025 rest assured the Liberals may highlight their efforts to control immigration as a key achievement in their election campaigns, claiming their win over  housing pressures and Inflation. However, limiting the flow of temporary foreign workers and Immigrants could lead to labour shortages in key sectors like construction, food service, hospitality and agriculture, potentially slowing economic growth and or increase the good and services prices further up due to lack of low wage workers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                As a large number of temporary work permits for low-wage workers are set to expire between 2025-2026 due to recent changes in immigration policies, Canada may face a significant labour shortage in key industries. This could leave businesses struggling to fill essential roles, raising questions about the sustainability of the government's Immigration policy approach. With the economy currently teetering between housing, inflation & immigration it seems that something will have to give in. These abrupt changes in immigration could also be a strategic move by Liberals to handover a weaker economy to Conservatives if the change of power happens in 2025 elections.
