                Canada’s economy thrives on hard work, dedication, and innovation. From bustling urban centers to small-town bakeries, many of the products we love are made possible by foreign workers who have chosen Canada as their new home. However, recent changes to immigration programs are threatening their ability to stay and continue contributing to the workforce.

                Two of the most well-known brands in the Maritimes, Mrs. Dunster’s and Fancy Pokket Bakery, are speaking out about how these immigration cuts will impact their businesses and workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                Blair Hyslop, co-CEO of Mrs. Dunster’s, revealed that 52% of their 275 employees were born outside Canada. Many of these workers came to the country with the hope of securing permanent residency through programs like New Brunswick’s Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP). However, with the province’s permanent residence application allocation cut from 5,500 to 2,750 for 2025, the pathway to staying in Canada is now uncertain.
                </p>
                <p>
                “We don’t get a lot of local applicants,” Hyslop explained. “I don’t know where we would be today without these employees.”
                </p>
                <h2>
                Immigrants Filling the Labor Shortage
                </h2>
                <p>
                Mike Timani, president of Fancy Pokket Bakery, echoed the same concerns. 82% of his 75 employees are immigrants or newcomers. Despite job postings, local applicants remain scarce.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Our doors are open for all individuals who would like to work,” Timani stated. “But the reality is, locals are generally not interested in these jobs.”
                </p>
                <p>
                This labor shortage is not unique to the baking industry. Many sectors, from food production to hospitality and manufacturing, rely heavily on foreign workers to keep operations running. Without them, supply chains suffer, and businesses struggle to meet consumer demand.

                <p>
                Beyond the economic impact, the emotional toll on affected workers is severe. Many came to Canada with the promise of building a better future. Now, they are left facing uncertainty and fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                “They’re crying,” Hyslop said about his employees. “They’re upset and trying to explain to their families, who invested everything to get them here, that they may not be able to stay.”
                </p>
                <p>
                In the next three years, 56 workers at Mrs. Dunster’s alone may lose their opportunity to stay in Canada, with 15 at risk this year. Without work permit renewals, they won’t be able to gain the necessary hours for permanent residency, leaving them devastated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                What This Means for Canada
                </h2>
                <p>
                Foreign workers are not just employees; they are community members, taxpayers, and future Canadian citizens. Their contributions fuel local businesses, sustain industries, and enrich Canadian culture. If pathways to permanent residency continue to shrink, Canada risks losing a dedicated workforce that has already proven its commitment.
                </p>
                <p>
                For businesses like Mrs. Dunster’s and Fancy Pokket, and for thousands of workers across the country, the message is clear: Canada’s success is built on the hard work of immigrants. Without them, industries will struggle, businesses will close, and communities will suffer.
                </p>
                <p>
                It’s time for policymakers to recognize the value of these workers and ensure that they have the opportunity to build their futures—right here in Canada.
