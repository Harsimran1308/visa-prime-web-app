                  As of July 7, 2025, applicants must demonstrate increased
                  financial capacity—at least $500 more than previously
                  required. For a single applicant, the required amount has
                  risen from $14,690 to $15,263.

                  Since mid-May, IRCC has alternated consistently between PNP
                  and CEC draws, with only a few category-based selections. This
                  pattern could indicate a longer-term direction in candidate
                  selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a result, the number of Express Entry profiles with CRS
                  scores above 500 has dropped for the first time in over six
                  months.

                <p>
                  As of July 11, 2025, Canada has expanded the list of Census

                  <li>
