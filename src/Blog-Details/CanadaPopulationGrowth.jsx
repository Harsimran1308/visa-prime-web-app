                  Canada’s Immigration Slowdown: A Turning Point for Population
                  Growth and Policy Reform
                </h2>

                <p>
                  In a significant shift from recent trends, Canada’s population
                  growth has sharply decelerated in the first quarter of the
                  year, marking the end of the post-pandemic immigration boom
                  that had pushed the country’s growth rate to historic highs.
                  For the past few years, Canada’s population increases rivaled
                  those of many fast-growing nations, largely fueled by a surge
                  in temporary residents — especially international students and
                  foreign workers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But that trend is now reversing. The number of temporary
                  residents fell to approximately 3 million — about 7.1% of the
                  total population — down from a peak of 7.4% last year. This
                  marks the largest non-pandemic quarterly drop on record. The
                  steepest decline came from the international student category,
                  with Ontario and British Columbia — traditionally the most
                  popular destinations — recording their largest quarterly
                  population losses since national data collection began in
                  1951.
                </p>

                <h2>A New Direction Under Prime Minister Carney</h2>

                <p>
                  The slowdown aligns with new policy direction from Prime
                  Minister Mark Carney’s government, which has pledged to bring
                  immigration levels to what it calls “sustainable” levels.
                  Carney, who took office after an April election victory,
                  inherits an immigration system that had already begun
                  tightening under his predecessor, Justin Trudeau.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To address growing concerns about system strain and social
                  integration, Carney’s government recently introduced
                  legislation aimed at tightening asylum claim rules. This
                  follows earlier caps on international student permits and
                  foreign worker visas. Lawmakers are expected to debate the
                  bill this week, which also aims to preempt a potential wave of
                  refugee claimants amid renewed immigration crackdowns in the
                  United States under President Donald Trump.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Despite the decrease in temporary residents, the number of
                  asylum seekers in Canada continues to climb — reaching a
                  record high of 470,029. This marks the 13th consecutive
                  quarterly increase, adding further urgency to Ottawa’s efforts
                  to reform the immigration system.
                </p>

                <h2>Balancing Growth with Public Sentiment</h2>

                <p>
                  Canada’s revised immigration strategy outlines a near-term
                  period of flat population growth, with plans to return to more
                  traditional expansion rates in the future. While the
                  government emphasizes the need for newcomers — particularly to
                  offset an aging workforce and declining birthrate — it also
                  acknowledges growing public skepticism toward open-door
                  immigration policies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the first quarter alone, deaths exceeded births by more
                  than 5,600 — underscoring the reality that all of Canada’s
                  current population growth stems from international migration.
                  Rebuilding public confidence while meeting the country’s
                  economic and demographic needs is now the delicate balancing
                  act facing policymakers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Prime Minister Carney has pledged to continue attracting top
                  global talent to support the Canadian economy, stating that
                  immigration will remain a pillar of national growth — but with
                  a stronger emphasis on sustainability and public buy-in.
