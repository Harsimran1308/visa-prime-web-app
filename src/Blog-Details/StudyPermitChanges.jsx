                Canada continues to be a top destination for international students, offering a
welcoming environment, high-quality educational institutions, and the potential for work
or immigration opportunities post-graduation. With an increasing number of students
choosing Canada for their studies, it is crucial that the International Student Program
(ISP) remains sustainable and fair. The Canadian government is taking concrete steps
to ensure the program’s integrity, safeguard students, and address concerns such as
fraud and exploitation.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Changes to the International Student Program</h3>
        <p>As of November 2024, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced several important regulatory changes designed to bolster the International Student Program. These changes aim to better protect international students and maintain the program's sustainability.</p>

                <section>
            <h3>1. Off-Campus Work Hours Increased to 24 Hours Per Week</h3>
            <p>One of the major changes to the program is the adjustment to the number of hours international students can work off-campus during the academic year. Previously, students were limited to 20 hours per week, but the new regulation allows eligible students to work up to 24 hours per week while their classes are in session. This change strikes a balance between offering students valuable work opportunities and ensuring they can focus on their studies.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"By fixing the off-campus work limit to 24 hours per week, we’re striking the right balance between providing work opportunities and helping students stay focused on their education."</p>
                <cite>- Minister Marc Miller</cite>
            </blockquote>

        <section>
            <h3>2. New Study Permit Requirements for Changing Institutions</h3>
            <p>Moving forward, international students will need to apply for and receive approval for a new study permit before changing institutions. This regulation aims to ensure that students follow the proper procedures and maintain the integrity of their study permits. By requiring approval before making changes, the government hopes to reduce the risk of fraud and ensure that students remain compliant with the program.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Stronger Accountability for Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs)</h3>
            <p>Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) play a critical role in supporting international students. The government is tightening the rules for DLIs, requiring them to submit compliance reports twice a year. These reports will confirm whether each international student remains enrolled at their institution. DLIs that fail to submit compliance reports or verify acceptance letters could face penalties, including being suspended from accepting new international students for up to one year.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"We also expect institutions to support our efforts to preserve the integrity of the International Student Program. International students should have a positive, successful experience in Canada, and the important changes made today will help with that."</p>
                <cite>- Minister Marc Miller</cite>
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>4. Full-Time Study Requirement for Off-Campus Work Eligibility</h3>
            <p>International students must be enrolled full-time in a post-secondary academic, vocational, or professional training program to work off-campus. These programs must last at least six months and lead to a degree, diploma, or certificate. During academic breaks, such as the winter or summer break, students are allowed to work full-time, further enhancing their ability to gain work experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Enhanced Compliance Reporting by DLIs</h3>
            <p>As part of the broader initiative to ensure compliance with the International Student Program, designated learning institutions are now required to submit reports to IRCC twice a year. These reports will indicate whether each international student remains enrolled. If a student is found to be out of compliance, enforcement actions may be taken, and students may face consequences for violating their study permit conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Note for Quebec DLIs:</strong> Quebec’s designated learning institutions (DLIs) have a grace period before they are required to start participating in compliance reporting. IRCC and Quebec authorities are still working to establish the reporting system in the province.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>6. Successful Launch of Letter of Acceptance (LOA) Verification</h3>
            <p>In an effort to combat fraudulent study permit applications, IRCC introduced a new process to verify Letters of Acceptance (LOAs) from designated learning institutions. Since its launch in December 2023, the new verification system has already proven successful. From December 2023 to October 2024, IRCC received nearly 529,000 LOAs for verification, confirming that over 492,000 of them were valid. The system also identified more than 17,000 LOAs that were either fraudulent or invalid, helping to prevent misuse of the program.</p>
