            question:"How can I apply for Permanent Residency in Canada?",
            answer:"You can apply for Permanent Residency through several programs, including Express Entry, the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), and Family Sponsorship. Each program has specific eligibility requirements based on factors like work experience, education, and family connections."
