                  <p>
                    The TFWP allows employers in Alberta to hire foreign
                    nationals to address labor shortages when no qualified
                    Canadian workers are available. The process often requires a
                    Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to confirm that
                    hiring a foreign worker will benefit or have a neutral
                    impact on the Canadian labor market. VisaPrime Consultancy
                    helps businesses in Edmonton, Fort McMurray, and nearby
                    areas secure the necessary LMIAs to bring in temporary
                    workers quickly and efficiently.
