              An authentic Canadian work permit is your key to working in
              Canada. Itâ€™s an official document, granted to foreign nationals
              for a set period. To get this, you need a valid job offer from a
              Canadian employer. They might need a Labour Market Impact
              Assessment (LMIA) as well, a crucial document assessing the effect
              of hiring a foreign worker on the Canadian job market. Get in
