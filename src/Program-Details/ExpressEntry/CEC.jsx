                  <p>
                    The CEC is a key component of Canada&#39;s Express Entry
                    system, tailored for temporary foreign workers and graduates
                    from Canadian institutions who have acquired skilled work
                    experience in Canada. Its purpose is to streamline the
                    transition from temporary status to permanent residency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Operated under the Express Entry system, the CEC employs the
                    Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to assess and rank
                    candidates. Those who achieve competitive CRS scores are
                    invited to apply for permanent residence.

                    In addition to the Canadian work experience requirement,
                    applicants must also meet other eligibility criteria,
                    including:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                    Candidates who meet these criteria can create an Express

                    However, it's crucial to also meet Canada's general
