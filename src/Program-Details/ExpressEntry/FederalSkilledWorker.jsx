                                        permanently in Canada. It utilizes the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to
                                        evaluate candidates based on their skills, work experience, and other factors. Unlike the
                                        Canadian Experience Class (CEC), applicants do not need Canadian work experience
                                        to qualify. Instead, they must meet a minimum points threshold based on criteria such
                                        as:</span>
