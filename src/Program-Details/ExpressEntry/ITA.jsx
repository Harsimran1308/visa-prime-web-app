                  <h2>What Happens After You Receive an ITA?</h2>
                  <p>
                    After getting an ITA, you have 60 days to submit an
                    electronic Application for Permanent Residence (eAPR)
                    through IRCC’s online portal. You’ll need to upload all the
                    required documents, such as your passport, work history
                    proof, and language test results, along with other
                    supporting documents. Receiving an ITA doesn’t automatically
                    mean you&#39;re approved for permanent residency. Your
                    application will go through further review by IRCC. If your
                    application is successful, you’ll receive confirmation of
                    your permanent resident status.

                  <h2>How to Get an Invitation to Apply (ITA)</h2>
                  <p>
                    To receive an ITA, the first step is submitting your Express
                    Entry profile. Once submitted, you’ll be ranked in the
                    Express Entry pool using the Comprehensive Ranking System
                    (CRS), a points-based system that evaluates factors such as
                    age, education, work experience, and language proficiency.
                    Candidates with the highest CRS scores are selected during
                    Express Entry draws and are sent an ITA. After receiving the
                    ITA, you’ll be able to apply for Canadian permanent
                    residency through the eAPR process.

                  <h2>How Long Does It Take to Receive an ITA?</h2>
                  <p>
                    The wait time to receive an ITA depends on how competitive
                    your CRS score is compared to other candidates in the
                    Express Entry pool. IRCC conducts regular Express Entry
                    draws, and if your CRS score is high, you could receive an
                    ITA in as little as a few days or weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are not selected immediately, don’t worry! Your
                    profile remains active in the pool for 12 months. If you’re
                    still waiting after several months, consider ways to improve
                    your CRS score—such as retaking language tests or exploring
                    provincial nomination opportunities.

                    Once you receive an ITA, the real work begins. You’ll need
                    to prepare and submit your electronic Application for
                    Permanent Residence (eAPR) within the 60-day deadline,
                    including scanning and submitting all required documents
                    through IRCC’s online portal. The ITA brings you closer to
                    achieving your goal of Canadian permanent residency, but
                    it’s essential to ensure that all your documents are
                    accurate and complete to avoid delays.
