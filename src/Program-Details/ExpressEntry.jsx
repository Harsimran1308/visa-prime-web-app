                                The Express Entry system is one of Canada's most popular pathways for skilled immigrants to obtain Permanent Residency (PR). While the process can be overwhelming, with proper guidance, it becomes straightforward. Our consultancy offers expert assistance to help you successfully navigate each step, from eligibility assessment to receiving your PR status.

                                Express Entry manages applications for three main immigration programs: Federal Skilled Worker (FSW), Federal Skilled Trades (FST), and Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Each program has unique requirements, but all are processed through the Express Entry pool, where applicants are ranked based on their CRS score. The higher your score, the better your chances of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for PR.
