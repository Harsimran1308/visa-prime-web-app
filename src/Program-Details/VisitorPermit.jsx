                  <p>
                    A visitor visa, also known as a temporary resident visa
                    (TRV), is an official document issued by Canadian
                    immigration authorities that permits you to enter Canada.
                    This visa is affixed as a counterfoil in your passport,
                    which you must present upon arrival at a Canadian border
                    entry point.

                  <h2>What Is a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP)?</h2>
                  <p>
                    A Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) may be issued to
                    individuals who would otherwise be inadmissible to Canada
                    due to health or criminal issues. It allows them to enter or
                    remain in Canada when compelling circumstances justify the
                    request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A TRP grants legal entry to Canada for a specified period
                    and can be applied for at any time. Unlike criminal
                    rehabilitation, a TRP does not have to adhere to a specific
                    time frame related to the completion of a sentence. This
                    means that an individual may receive a TRP even while still
                    serving part of their sentence, depending on the
                    circumstances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TRPs are typically issued for the duration of your stay in
                    Canada, with a maximum validity of up to three years, and
                    can be extended from within Canada.

                    Not necessarily. While a visitor visa allows you to travel
                    to Canada, the ultimate decision regarding entry is made by
                    an officer from the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA)
                    at the port of entry. They must determine that you have the
                    intent and means to leave Canada after your visit. Entry
                    denial is uncommon but can occur if requirements are not
                    satisfied.

                  <h2>Why Does Canada Deny Travelers Who Have a DUI?</h2>
                  <p>
                    To protect the safety and well-being of Canada and its
                    citizens, travelers with a past charge or conviction, such
                    as a Driving Under the Influence (DUI) offense, may be
                    deemed criminally inadmissible to the country. For U.S.
                    travelers, even minor offenses in some states, including a
                    DUI, can create admissibility issues at the Canadian border.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of 2018, a DUI can now be prosecuted by up to 10 years in
                    prison, classifying it as a serious crime in Canada.
                    Criminal inadmissibility is assessed based on the
                    equivalency of a foreign criminal offense to Canadian law.
                    Therefore, understanding how a DUI or any criminal offense
                    committed in the United States translates under Canadian law
                    is crucial. Given that DUIs are considered serious
                    criminality in Canada, individuals with past offenses should
                    be cautious and address potential admissibility issues prior
                    to traveling.

                  <h2>What Types of Visitor Visas Are Available in Canada?</h2>
                  <p>Visitor visas are primarily categorized into two types:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Single Entry Visa:</strong> This allows a one-time
                      entry into Canada. After leaving, a new visa application
                      will be required for re-entry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Multiple Entry Visa:</strong> This visa allows
                      multiple entries into Canada over its validity period,
                      which can be up to 10 years. However, it is limited by the
                      expiration date of your passport, typically expiring one
                      month before your passport's validity ends.

                  <h2>How Long Can I Stay in Canada with a Visitor Visa?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Most visitors are permitted to stay in Canada for a maximum
                    of 6 months. However, parents applying under the Super Visa
                    program can remain in Canada for up to 5 years, which is an
                    increase from the previous limit of 2 years.

                  <h2>Can I Extend My Visitor Visa?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Yes, extending your visitor visa is possible. A CBSA officer
                    may grant you permission to stay for a shorter or longer
                    period than 6 months. If no specific date is mentioned, you
                    must leave Canada by the expiration date of your visa or
                    within 6 monthsâ€”whichever comes first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To extend your visitor visa, you should submit your
                    extension application at least 30 days prior to your visa's
                    expiration date.

                    extend your stay in Canada. It specifies the new date by
