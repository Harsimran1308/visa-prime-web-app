                    Starting September 30, 2024, the AAIP will introduce a new
                    system designed to streamline the immigration process by
                    selecting candidates based on specific criteria. To prepare
                    for this transition, the AAIP has canceled the remaining
                    2024 application intake dates. This change aims to improve
                    efficiency and better align applicants with Alberta's labor
                    market needs.

                    Quebec Premier François Legault has announced a six-month
                    freeze on new temporary foreign workers for low-wage jobs in
                    Montreal, starting September 3. The freeze, affecting
                    renewals and certain sectors, aims to protect the French
                    language and public services and is expected to reduce
                    temporary immigration by 3,500.

                    The Canadian government is reducing the use of the Temporary
                    Foreign Worker (TFW) Program by limiting access in
                    high-unemployment areas, lowering the foreign worker
                    percentage, and capping low-wage stream workers to one year.
                    These measures aim to prioritize Canadian workers and adapt
                    to current labor market conditions.

                    IRCC has ended the temporary policy allowing visitors to
                    apply for work permits from within Canada, effective
                    immediately. This policy, introduced in August 2020 due to
                    COVID-19, was initially set to expire in 2025 but was
                    terminated early to prevent misuse and protect the
                    immigration system. Applications submitted before August 28,
                    2024, will still be processed under this policy.
