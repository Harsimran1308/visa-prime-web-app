                    The process of extending invitations commenced on both
                    October 10th and 23rd. These invitations were dispatched to
                    potential sponsors who had submitted their applications in
                    the year 2020. A total of 24,200 potential sponsors are in
                    the pool. The objective of the Immigration, Refugees, and
                    Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is to acquire and process 15,000
                    complete sponsorship applications.

                    On October 19, the Honorable Marc Miller, Minister of IRCC,
                    announced the Pilot Program for CAN work in the Philippines,
                    located at IRCCâ€™s visa office in Manila. This program is
                    open to Canadian employers recruiting from the Philippines
                    and hiring approximately 50 or more workers or for critical
                    occupations such as in healthcare, construction, and
                    agri-food.

                      New Minimum wage has taken effect in Ontario, Manitoba,

                    As illustrated in the graph, it is evident that certain
                    provinces have implemented an increase in the minimum wage.
                    This noteworthy adjustment in the minimum wage standards has
                    far-reaching implications, encompassing not only domestic
                    workers but also extending to foreign national workers who
                    have chosen Canada as their destination for employment
                    opportunities.

                    Effective October 1st, a change in the Express Entry process
                    eliminates the necessity for initial medical assessments. In
                    the past, applicants were obligated to complete the
                    Immigrant Medical Exam (IME) conducted by authorized panel
                    physicians. However, individuals who have not previously
                    undergone an IME can now streamline the process by uploading
                    an empty document within their Express Entry profile. The
                    IRCC will subsequently provide instructions on when to
                    arrange their medical examination. This modification
                    simplifies the application procedure for prospective
                    immigrants.

                    On September 21, 2023, India implemented a suspension on
                    visa issuance specifically in Ottawa, Toronto, and
                    Vancouver. Subsequently, this temporary visa suspension for
                    Canadian citizens was extended to apply globally. However,
                    as of October 25, 2023, the High Commission of India in
                    Canada officially communicated the resumption of visa
                    application processing in Ottawa, along with the consulates
                    situated in Toronto and Vancouver. This signifies a positive
                    development for Canadian citizens seeking visas for travel
                    to India, as the visa application process is once again open
                    for their convenience.
