                      To decrease the housing issue, Canada is considering
                      imposing a cap on foreign student visas. According to
                      official figures, there will be over 800,000 foreign
                      students with active visas in 2022, up from 275,000 in
                      2012. Because obtaining a work visa in Canada is very
                      simple, it is a popular location for international
                      students. Fraser, who was immigration minister before
                      taking over as housing minister last month, said the steep
                      increase in the number of students was putting significant
                      strain on some property markets. He emphasized that the
                      government has not yet taken a decision.

                      The rest of 2023 appears to be a balanced mix of draw
                      kinds. Some will be all-program or program-specific draws
                      with higher minimum CRS scores and fewer ITAs given.
                      Others will be category-based selection draws with lower
                      CRS scores. However, even with a lower minimum CRS, the
                      quantity of category-based invitations sent can vary.

                      In response to the fatal assault of a Sikh separatist on
                      Canadian soil, India has suspended giving visas to
                      Canadian citizens. India stated that the temporary
                      relocation was necessary owing to "security threats"
                      affecting operating at its missions in Canada. Visa
                      services from Canada are still available in India.

                      for the said program. It aims to receive up to 15,000
                      complete applications. If you submitted interest to
                      sponsor in 2020 but did not receive an invitation to apply
                      in 2021 or 2022, you should check the email address you
                      provided in 2020.
