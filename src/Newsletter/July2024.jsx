                    British Columbiaâ€™s Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and
                    Future Skills has introduced new rules mandating public
                    Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) to cap international
                    student enrollment at 30%. These guidelines involve adopting
                    the Education Quality Assurance (EQA) code, maintaining
                    clear tuition fees, and meeting rigorous quality standards.
                    Non-compliant institutions will lose their EQA designation
                    and will no longer be able to enroll international students.
