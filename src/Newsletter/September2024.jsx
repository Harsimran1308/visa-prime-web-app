                    International students in Canada are facing uncertainty due
                    to new federal policies limiting off-campus work hours to 24
                    per week, reducing student visas by 35%, and decreasing
                    pathways to permanent residency. These changes raise
                    concerns about financial stability and career opportunities,
                    impacting students' views of Canada as an immigrant-friendly
                    country.

                    To improve your chances of obtaining Canadian Permanent
                    Residency (PR), stay updated on immigration policies and
                    PGWP eligibility, pursue in-demand careers in healthcare,
                    STEM, and trades, and explore Provincial Nominee Programs
                    (PNPs) to enhance your CRS score. Additionally, boost your
                    language skills and validate your degrees. These strategies
                    can strengthen your PR application and facilitate your
                    settlement in Canada.

                    Canada is reforming its immigration system to lower
                    temporary residents from 6.5% to 5% by 2026. Key changes
                    include reducing study permits by 10%, tightening work
                    permit rules for spouses of master's students and foreign
                    workers, and strengthening the asylum system. These measures
                    prioritize Canadian workers, with more details in the
                    Immigration Levels Plan due by November 1, 2024.

                    Canada is tightening its immigration system to reduce
                    temporary residents. IRCC will cap study permits at 437,000
                    in 2025, with new requirements for master’s and PhD students
                    to obtain a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL). Stricter
                    Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) rules, including higher
                    language benchmarks, may result in 175,000 fewer permits.
                    Spousal work permits will also face tighter restrictions.
                    These measures aim to manage immigration numbers while
                    addressing labor shortages, with more reforms expected soon.
