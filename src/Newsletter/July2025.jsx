                <h2>🔹 PGP Sponsorship Invitations Begin July 28</h2>
    <p>
      Canadian citizens and permanent residents may soon have the opportunity to bring their parents or grandparents to live with them permanently in Canada. Beginning <strong>July 28, 2025</strong>, the federal government will start issuing <strong>17,860 invitations</strong> to potential sponsors over a two-week period, aiming to accept <strong>10,000 full applications</strong> this year.
    </p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Key Points:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only individuals who submitted an Interest to Sponsor form in 2020 will be eligible to receive an invitation.</li>
      <li>No new forms are being accepted at this time.</li>
      <li>Those not selected may still explore the Super Visa, which allows parents and grandparents to stay in Canada for up to 10 years.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="highlight">Quick Comparison – PGP vs. Super Visa:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>PGP grants permanent resident status.</li>
      <li>Super Visa allows long-term visits but requires the host to meet income criteria and the applicant to have valid health insurance.</li>
