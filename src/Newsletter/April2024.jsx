                      allocation of international students to provinces and

                    Minister Marc Miller finalized provincial and territorial
                    study permit allocations for 2024 to control international
                    student numbers. The national cap sets a target of 364,000
                    approved study permits, with exemptions for certain
                    categories, leading to a target of 236,000. Allocations were
                    based on population share, with growth limited to 10% for
                    some regions. Additional support was given to provinces with
                    lower approval rates. Approximately 552,000 study permit
                    applications were allocated, expecting 292,000 approved
                    permits, a 28% reduction from 2023. The government aims to
                    manage student flow while supporting regional immigration
                    goals.

                    Danielle Smith announced five significant updates to the
                    Alberta Advantage Immigration Program (AAIP), aiming to
                    simplify permanent residency for foreign workers and
                    entrepreneurs. Notably, the program will collaborate with
                    the federal Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot to assist
                    skilled refugees. Additionally, a dedicated pathway for
                    medical professionals will be established, with 30% of the
                    Express Entry Stream allocation reserved for healthcare
                    workers in 2023. Streamlining the application process for
                    rural workers and reducing the investment requirement for
                    the Rural Entrepreneur Stream to $100,000 will encourage
                    more entrepreneurship in rural Alberta. Finally, a new
                    direct phone line will connect AAIP staff with applicants,
                    emphasizing Alberta's commitment to talent retention and
                    community needs.

                    The New Canada Work Permit Innovation Stream Pilot is now
                    accepting applications, as announced by Immigration,
                    Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on April 15. Through
                    the Global Hypergrowth Project, this 2-year pilot enables
                    select Canadian companies to hire highly skilled foreign
                    workers without requiring an LMIA (Labour Market Impact
                    Assessment). Positions falling under National Occupational
                    Classification (NOC) categories 0, 1, 2, or 3 are considered
                    high-skilled. Moreover, family members of these workers are
                    eligible for open work permits, granting them the
                    flexibility to work for any employer in Canada. The
                    Innovation Stream is set to run until March 22, 2026, unless
                    otherwise specified. This initiative aligns with the Canada
                    Tech Strategy announced by the immigration minister on June
                    27, 2023, aiming to attract talented individuals to
                    contribute to innovative business ventures.

                    Starting this fall, international students in Canada will
                    have their off-campus work hours limited to 24 per week, a
                    reduction from the current 40 hours permitted during the
                    academic year. Immigration Minister Marc Miller stated that
                    this adjustment aims to restore the previous work-hour
                    limit, which was temporarily lifted during the pandemic to
                    address labor shortages and alleviate financial pressures on
                    students. Miller emphasized that the primary purpose of the
                    international student program is for studying, and the
                    relaxation of work-hour restrictions is no longer deemed
                    necessary for economic recovery.
