                    Immigration Minister Marc Miller addressed that the plan
                    would stabilize the newcomers arriving in Canada. In an
                    official statement, he emphasized the importance of
                    considering housing, infrastructure planning, and
                    sustainable population growth. In 2024, Canada aims to
                    welcome 281,135 immigrants under the economic class,
                    comprising 58% of the annual target. By 2026, this number
                    will increase to 301,250 immigrants, representing 60% of the
                    annual target.

                    for Canada’s Future." As part of the government's plan to
                    enhance the experience for newcomers, Canada aims to
                    expedite the processing of specific visitor visas,
                    particularly for those applying for tourism, major
                    conferences, and events.

                    Ontario plans to introduce groundbreaking legislation that,
                    if approved, would prohibit employers from mandating
                    "Canadian work experience" in job postings or application
                    forms. As stated in a recent government news release, this
                    modification aims to facilitate qualified candidates'
                    advancement in the interview process, making it easier for
                    internationally trained immigrants to secure meaningful
                    employment and contribute to Ontario's development.

                    In the most recent population estimate, Canada's
                    non-permanent residents (NPRs) total 2,198,679 individuals,
                    marking a disparity of over one million from the Census 2021
                    figures. This report holds significance as Statistics Canada
                    recognizes its prior undercounting of the NPR population in
                    the country. The revised methodology carries considerable
                    implications for various aspects of Canadian public policy,
                    encompassing immigration, economic and labor market
                    planning, housing, and other critical areas.

                    Canada launched a humanitarian program on November 17 for
                    Colombians, Haitians, and Venezuelans. To qualify,
                    applicants need Canadian relatives willing to support them
                    for a year. Successful candidates receive pre-arrival
                    services, job skills assessment, and settlement service
                    referrals. Financial aid from the Resettlement Assistance
                    Program may also be available. Canada will admit 4,000
                    individuals from the Americas through temporary worker
                    programs, providing an alternative to irregular migration
                    for those affected by instability in their home countries.
