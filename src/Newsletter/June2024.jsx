                  <p>
                    Effective June 11, 2024, the following streams and pathways
                    have adopted the new approach: Alberta Opportunity Stream,
                    Rural Renewal Stream, Accelerated Tech Pathway, and Tourism
                    and Hospitality Stream. Applications will be accepted
                    monthly, and when a stream or pathway's monthly application
                    target is reached, no further applications will be accepted
                    until the next date. The demand to immigrate to Alberta is
                    far higher than the province can accommodate within the
                    limited number of nominations received from the federal
                    government every year.

                    This new pathway means that caregivers can more easily find
                    proper work with reliable employers and have clear,
                    straightforward access to permanent resident status as soon
                    as they arrive in Canada. Through these new pilot programs,
                    candidates interested in working in Canadaâ€™s home care
                    sector will be eligible to apply if they meet the following
                    criteria: attain a minimum of level 4 based on the Canadian
                    Language Benchmarks (CLB), hold the equivalent of a Canadian
                    high school diploma, have recent and relevant work
                    experience, and receive an offer for a full-time home care
                    job.

                    As of June 2024, IRCC updates processing times monthly for
                    citizenship, family sponsorships, and economic immigration,
                    and weekly for PR cards, temporary residence, and business
                    immigration. Processing times help applicants set
                    expectations, starting from when a complete application is
                    received until a decision is made. Citizenship grants take 8
                    months, while PR cards take 77 days for new ones and 71 days
                    for renewals. Family sponsorships range from 10 months for
                    non-Quebec spouses to 48 months for Quebec
                    parents/grandparents. The backlog includes 897,100
                    applications, with a total inventory of 2.2 million as of
                    April 30, 2024.
